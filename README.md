# NLP Chatbot

This project is a contextual chatbot neural network using Python's pytorch library. It is trained with a JSON file containing phrases mapped to categories which represent different language scenarios. The program takes in user inputs and deciphers the context of the message, then chooses a response from the learned list of responses and displays it to the user.
